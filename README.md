*** WARNING ***

`

snap-o-matic is an automatic snapshot tool for Exoscale Compute instances.

## Installation

You can install it either by downloading the binaries from the
[releases section](https://github.com/exoscale-labs/snap-o-matic/releases).

## Usage as a binary

**You should configure snap-o-matic to run from a cronjob.**  Each run of snap-o-matic creates a single snapshot and
cleans up old ones.

You can run the `snap-o-matic` program with the following parameters:

 - **`-f FILENAME` or `--credentials-file FILENAME`:** File to read API credentials from.
 - **`-d` or `--dry-run`:** Run in dry-run mode (do not actually make a snapshot).
 - **`-i INSTANCE_ID` or `--instance-id INSTANCE_ID`:** The instance to back up. If not provided the instance snap-o-matic is running on will be backed up.
 - **`-L LOG_LEVEL` or `--log-level LOG_LEVEL`:** Logging level, supported values: `error`,`info`,`debug` (default `info`).
 - **`-r NUMBER` or `--snapshot-retention NUMBER`:** Maximum snapshots to keep (default 7).

Credentials can be passed either as a credentials file, or as environment variables. Supported environment variables:

 - **`EXOSCALE_API_KEY`:** Exoscale API key.
 - **`EXOSCALE_API_SECRET`:** Exoscale API secret.

API credentials file format:

```
api_key=EXOabcdef0123456789abcdef01
api_secret=AbCdEfGhIjKlMnOpQrStUvWxYz-0123456789aBcDef
